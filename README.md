# Landing-Page
this is an assignment of theodinproject.com

this is a landing page of a travel company called ***Bharat Yatra*** (which literally means **trip to india**)

in this project i solely used **flexbox only** for positioning and some basic tags semantics and non semantics.

huge credit goes to 
1- google
2- w3schools
